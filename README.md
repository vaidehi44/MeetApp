# MeetApp
As a part of Microsoft Engage Mentorship program I have built a video calling and chatting webapp using the WebRTC technology. My client-side consists of ReactJS and server-side is made with NodeJS along with sockets.io for socket connections and peerjs for RTCPeerConnections.

It has been hosted online on heroku and netlify. Link for the same is - https://my-meetapp-webrtc.netlify.com
